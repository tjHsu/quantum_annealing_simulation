# Quantum Annealing Simulation (No Longer Actively Maintained)

## Introduction

### Goal

The code simulate the quantum annealing process when solving an optimisation problem based on spin-2 system. If one can map their problems into a combinatorial optimisation form, it has the potential to be solved with quantum annealer, which can be simulated with this code.

### Usage

With a predefined interaction paramerter of each qubits and initial state, the code show the result of the final state after certain period of annealing time.

The simulation can run either with 0 temperatue (ideal case) or a finite temperature (real case)
